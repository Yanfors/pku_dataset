Each year, around 10,000 auto-HSCT are performed on myeloma patients in Europe [3] withapproximately the same number as in the USA [4].One of the main side effects of the HSCT is oralmucositis, which has negative impacts on the quality of lifeand survival of the patients as well as on health-care costs[5]. Already in 2006 the ﬁrst[5]. Already in 2006 the ﬁrstrandomised, placebo-randomised, placebo-controlled trial to show that cryotherapy gave a signiﬁcantreduction in oral mucositis in myeloma patients who wereundergoing auto-HSCT was published [6]. However, themethod was described as early as 1991 in patients treatedwith 5-ﬂuorouracil for cancer and the mechanism of actionof cryotherapy was suggested to be vasoconstriction that isinduced by the cooling of the oral mucosa, thereby pro-tecting it from the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapy [7].The therapeutic efﬁcacy of cryotherapy in this setting hasbeen conﬁrmed in several trials, and it is currently regardedas the standard-of-care prophylactic regimen for oralmucositis in patients undergoing auto-HSCT for myeloma[8–12]. However, the long duration of the treatment (7 h), asreported in the original study [6], has been associated withsigniﬁcant discomfort for the patients, with negative con-sequences for compliance. Based partly on the results ofstudies on the pharmacokinetics of melphalan in patientswith myeloma who are undergoing high-dose chemotherapy[13, 14], uncontrolled trials testing cryotherapy for <7 h hasbeen performed in patients with myeloma who receive auto-HSCT [15, 16]. The present prospective, randomised studyinvestigates whether 2 h of cryotherapy is as effective as 7 hof cryotherapy in protecting against oral mucositis in thosepatients who are subjected to high-dose melphalan as aconditioning agent for auto-SCT for myeloma.Methods",

Excluded were those patients who had a diagnosis ofamyloidosis or who had plasmocytoma located close to theoral cavity, as well as those patients who had <2 × 106/kg ofcollected cryopreserved stem cells and patients who werescheduled for conditioning with an agent other than mel-phalan at a dosage of 140 or 200 mg/m2.The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Com-mittee of Sahlgrenska University Hospital (diary number262–13).262–13).RandomisationRandomisationThe principal investigator of the study identiﬁed eligiblepatients and all the included patients gave informed, writtenconsent before inclusion.consent before inclusion.The patients were randomised 1:1 using simple rando-misation with numbered sealed opaque envelopes to receiveeither 2 or 7 h of cryotherapy.

The actual duration of cryother-apy was registered for all patients, although the ﬁnal ana-lysis was intention to treat based on the treatment group.Assessment of oral mucositisAssessment of oral mucositisOral mucositis was evaluated by a few selected dentists withspecial training in assessing oral mucositis using both theWHO and Oral Mucositis Assessment Score (OMAS)scales. A validation meeting was arranged before the start ofthe study to achieve consensus among the dentists regardingthe evaluation of mucositis. Oral mucositis was gradedimmediately before the start of the cryotherapy (Day −2),immediately before the stem cellinfusion (Day 0) andinfusion (Day 0) andthereafter daily on all weekdays from Day +4 until totalresolution of the mucositis (i.e., grade 0 according to boththe WHO and OMAS scales).the WHO and OMAS scales).Additional therapyAdditional therapyAll patients received the same prophylactic antibiotics in theform of orally administered ciproﬂoxacin at 1000 mg/dayfrom Day −2 until engraftment (the ﬁrst of 3 consecutivedays with absolute neutrophil count ≥0.5 × 109/L), acyclovirat 1600 mg/day from Day −2 to Day +180, and trimetho-prim/sulfamethoxazole from Day −2 to Day −1 and fromengraftment to Day +180. Patients who were colonised withfungi were also administered ﬂuconazole 200 mg/day fromDay −2 to Day +28. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) wasgenerally started when the daily oral caloric intake droppedbelow approximately 50% of basic needs and was tapered offand stopped when the daily caloric intake exceeded 50% ofbasic needs.

Patients who were colonised withfungi were also administered ﬂuconazole 200 mg/day fromDay −2 to Day +28. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) wasgenerally started when the daily oral caloric intake droppedbelow approximately 50% of basic needs and was tapered offand stopped when the daily caloric intake exceeded 50% ofbasic needs. All patients received anti-emetic therapy (palo-nosetron) during the conditioning therapy and in additionreceived 8 mg dexamethasone from Day −2 until Day 0.Melphalan conditioningMelphalan conditioningOutcome measuresOutcome measuresA single dose of 200 mg/m2 of melphalan was infusedthrough a central venous catheter over 30 min on Day −2The primary study endpoint of non-inferiority was theincidence of grade 3 and grade 4 oral mucositis accordingCryotherapy as prophylaxis against oral mucositis after high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell. . .the WHO criteria [18]. Secondary endpoints were:thetheincidence of oral ulcers graded according to the OMAS[19]; the incidence and duration of TPN; the incidence ofuse of opioid analgesics; the incidence of bacteraemia andfever (body temperature ≥38 °C); and the duration of thehospital stay.hospital stay.receiving 7 h of cryotherapy would develop grade 3 or 4oral mucositis [6], it was anticipated that a difference >20%between the treatment groups would be clinically relevant.Accordingly, the null hypothesis was that if the true severemucositis rate for 7 h of cryotherapy is 15% then the cor-responding true severe mucositis rate for 2 h of cryotherapyis ≥35% (non-inferiority limit of 20%).Statistical analysisStatistical analysisIt was hypothesised that 2 h of cryotherapy would be non-inferior to 7 h of cryotherapy with a non-inferiority marginof 20% with respect to the rate of severe (grades 3 and 4)mucositis according to the WHO criteria. Given thethe patientsthe patientsassumption that approximately 15% ofFig. 1 Trial proﬁleFig. 1 Trial proﬁleThe required size of the study population was thereforecalculated to be at a minimum 80 evaluable patients (40 perarm), giving at least 80% power for a one-sided test of thesehypotheses with a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 (SealedEnvelope Ltd. 2012.
